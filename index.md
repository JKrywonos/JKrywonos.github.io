I am a resident PhD student at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and obtaining my degree from York University, under the supervision of [Prof. Matthew Johnson](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/matthew-johnson). Previously, I did the [Perimeter Scholars International Master’s program](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program), where I was supervised by [Prof. Will Percival](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/will-percival). Originally, I am from Okanagan, BC, Canada which led me to do my Bachelors degree at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan campus with [Dr. John Hopkinson](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/john-hopkinson/). During this time I did a summer undergraduate internship at Perimeter Institute with [Dr. Ghazal Geshnizjani](https://ghazalgeshnizjani.wordpress.com/). 

My research is in cosmology, primarily working at the intersection between theory and observation with a focus on large-scale structure. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy surveys are essential components of our efforts to map the large-scale universe, and upcoming surveys will provide even more statistical power to constrain cosmological models. My work is focused on methods to take advantage of these upcoming surveys - from improving our analysis pipelines to utilizing new observables - to help gain information about fundamental physics. This has included looking into the statistical robustness of baryon acoustic oscillations and CMB constraints, as well as investigating modeling choices used for photometric galaxy clustering constraints. I am also working on kinetic Sunyaev Zel’dovich (kSZ) and polarized Sunyaev Zel’dovich (pSZ) tomography. New CMB experiments will drastically improve our secondary CMB measurements, so kSZ/pSZ tomography will utilize this and the benefits of a multi-tracer analysis. Additionally, I am interested in applications of machine learning to cosmology, which motivated a project on using machine learning to infer continuous 3D matter fields from galaxies.
